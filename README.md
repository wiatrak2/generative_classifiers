# Evaluation of suitability of conditional generative models for classification
----
This repository contains resources created during my master thesis development. You could notice, that the code sometimes refers to `distsup` module - it is a project developed during [JSALT 2019](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/distant-supervision-for-representation-learning-in-speech-and-handwriting/) stored in a private repository. However, all the facilities used to evaluate and compare reconstructors may be executed with custom models.
